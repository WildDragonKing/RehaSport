Use case: RehaSport template refinement
Primary request: same shot and same design as source clip, but make movement smoother and more natural.
Scene/background: unchanged from source.
Subject: unchanged avatar identity, same outfit, same scale.
Action: shoulder circles with natural biomechanics; continuous circular path, soft acceleration/deceleration, no abrupt stops.
Camera: unchanged locked camera.
Lighting/mood: unchanged.
Style/format: unchanged minimal product-style rehab demo.
Timing/beats: keep 8s structure and direction order (forward then backward), but transitions between phases should be fluid.
Constraints: keep everything visually the same; change only motion quality.
Avoid: robotic timing, sharp speed jumps, stiff shoulders, jerky elbows, frame jitter, extra body gestures.
