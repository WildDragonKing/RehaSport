Scene/background: bright white studio with subtle light-gray planes and thin separator lines, no clutter, no equipment, no decorative props.
Subject: fixed avatar identity "SageGuide-01", neutral face, short dark hair, no logos, non-real person.
Style/medium: modern stylized 3D, crisp and clean, low visual noise, editorial-tech healthcare aesthetic.
Composition/framing: landscape frame, medium-wide front shot, torso and arms clearly visible, centered and balanced.
