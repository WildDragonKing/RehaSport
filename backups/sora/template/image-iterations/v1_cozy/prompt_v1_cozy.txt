Subject: keep same avatar identity, same face, same hair, same proportions, same centered composition.
Style/medium: stylized 3D, polished, calm, premium, not photoreal.
Lighting/mood: soft warm-diffuse key light with gentle ambient fill; friendly evening-studio vibe; smooth shadows.
Color palette: warm off-white, muted sage, soft charcoal, subtle warm beige accents; keep green shirt readable but not neon.
