Subject: one fixed stylized 3D rehab avatar named "SageGuide-01" (non-real person, neutral face, short dark hair, light sage training shirt, sand pants, no logos).
Action: avatar performs slow, precise shoulder circles with clear start/end posture and one visible repetition cycle for forward and backward direction.
Camera: static medium-wide shot, eye-level, centered composition, no zoom, no cuts.
Lighting/mood: soft diffuse daylight, calm clinical atmosphere, high readability of shoulder movement.
Color palette: sage green (#7c9a82), sand (#f2ebe0), terracotta accent (#c4927a), lime accent (#84cc16) only as tiny details.
Style/format: clean modern rehab instruction aesthetic matching a calm healthcare web UI; minimal visual noise.
Timing/beats: 8 seconds total; 1s neutral start posture, 3s forward circles, 3s backward circles, 1s neutral end posture.
Audio: no music, no voiceover, no text overlays.
Constraints: same character identity and outfit should be reusable as master template for future clips.
Avoid: real-person realism, shaky camera, jump cuts, fast motion, clutter, dark dramatic lighting, branded items.
